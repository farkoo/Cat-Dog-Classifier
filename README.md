# Cat-Dog-Classifier

The purpose of this project is to train a model that can clasify images of dogs and cats into two separate groups.

In the first to fourth parts, an attempt is made to train the model without the use of a convolutional neural networks, and in general, in each of the second to fourth parts, an attempt is made to select the best one for this problem by examining various hyperparameters.
