# Cat-Dog-Classifier

The purpose of this project is to train a model that can clasify images of dogs and cats into two separate groups.

In the first to fourth parts, an attempt is made to train the model without the use of a convolutional neural networks, and in general, in each of the second to fourth parts, an attempt is made to select the best one for this problem by examining various hyperparameters.

## What we do need?

```
Keras
Tensorflow
Scikit learn
Numpy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
```

If you can not use GPU, using Google Colaboratory you can use the gpu to train your model.

## Part 1
Designing the primary neural network

In this part, the initial neural network was designed and implemented. Also, to solve the problem of overfitting the model, Drop Out and Data Augmentation were used.
